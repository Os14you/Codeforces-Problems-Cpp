# [Interval](https://codeforces.com/group/MWSDmqGsZm/contest/219158/problem/S)

Given a number X. Determine in which of the following intervals the number X belongs to:

**[0,25]**, **(25,50]**, **(50,75]**, **(75,100]**

**Note:**

- if X belongs to any of the above intervals print "**Interval**" followed by the interval.
- if X **does not belong to** any of the above intervals print "**Out of Intervals**".
- The symbol '**(**' represents greater than.
- The symbol '**)**' represents smaller than.
- The symbol '**[**' represents greater than or equal.
- The symbol '**]**' represents smaller than or equal.

**For example:**

- **[0,25]** indicates numbers between 0 and 25.0000, including both.

- **(25,50]** indicates numbers greater than 25: (25.00001) up to 50.0000000.

### Input

- Only one line containing a number X ( - 1000 ≤ X ≤ 1000).

### Output

- Print the answer to the problem above.
