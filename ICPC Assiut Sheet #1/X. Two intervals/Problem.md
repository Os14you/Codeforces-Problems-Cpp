# [Two intervals](https://codeforces.com/group/MWSDmqGsZm/contest/219158/problem/X)

Given the boundaries of 2 intervals. 
Print the boundaries of their intersection.

**Note:** Boundaries mean the two ends of an interval which are the starting number and the ending number.

### Input

- Only one line contains two intervals [$l_1$,$r_1$], [$l_2$,$r_2$] where ($1 ≤ l_1,l_2,r_1,r_2 ≤ 10^9$), ($l_1≤r_1$,$l_2≤r_2$) .
- It's guaranteed that $l_1≤r_1$ and $l_2≤r_2$.

### Output

- If there is an intersection between these 2 intervals print its boundaries , otherwise print -1.
