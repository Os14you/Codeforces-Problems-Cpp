Given 2 numbers A and B. 
Print floor, ceil and round of A/B

**Note:**

- ***Floor:*** Is a mathematical function that takes a real number X and its output is the **greatest** integer **less than** or **equal to** X.
- ***Ceil:*** Is a mathematical function that takes a real number X and its output is the **smallest** integer **larger than** or **equal to** x.
- ***Round:*** Is a mathematical function that takes a real number X and its output is the **closest** integer to that number X.
