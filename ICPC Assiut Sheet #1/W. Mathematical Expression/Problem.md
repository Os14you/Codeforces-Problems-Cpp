# [Mathematical Expression](https://codeforces.com/group/MWSDmqGsZm/contest/219158/problem/W)

Given a mathematical expression. The expression will be one of the following expressions:

$$A + B = C, A - B = C, A * B = C$$

where A, B, C are three numbers, S is the sign between A and B, and Q the '=' sign .
Print "Yes" If the expression is Right , Otherwise print the right answer of the expression.

### Input

- Only one line containing the expression: A,S,B,Q,C respectively ($0 ≤ A,B ≤ 100$,$-10^5 ≤ C ≤ 10^5$) and S can be ('$+$', '$-$', '$*$') without the quotation.

### Output

- Output either "Yes" (without the quotation) or the right answer depending on the statement.
